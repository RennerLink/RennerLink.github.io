      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a senior in high school near Portland, Oregon. I have always been a builder, visualizing projects in 3D and then making them come to life with blocks or LEGOÂ® products. Along with my own creations, I've always had a fascination with building design and enjoy exploring and photographing the urban Portland landscape. In 2023, I was able to participate in the ACE Mentor Program and take a course in engineering and design. When I am not building new creations or documenting my builds for my YouTube channel, I am exploring Portland on my bike or playing soccer.
