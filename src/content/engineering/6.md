This pole climber can fit on poles of varying sizes. It separates like a bracelet. After being clipped around the pole, it squeezes on to maximize grip. Then it uses treads to climb up. Unfortunately, it didn't end up working very well. It was too heavy and would slip down the pole. The treads would also often slip as they were plastic and only had small rubber dots for grip.
