For this build, I wanted to use the concept of a self-navigating robot (such as a Roomba) and make it work 100% mechanically without having any of the decisions be made electronically. The idea is that one motor feeds into a complex gearbox full of mechanical switches. Then the physical design of the robot with levers and buttons can determine a drive program. For example, there was a sliding beam on the front of the robot that would change the driving direction. So if it bumped into something it would start backing up. I then planned to have the beam slowly be driven into position. While the beam was sliding back to its primed position, it would activate turning mode, and the build would turn 90 degrees before continuing to drive straight. This program would allow it to escape any maze and navigate most rooms.
