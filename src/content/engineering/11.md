This robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to take depth measurements of its surroundings. The sensor is mounted from above and can rotate a full 180 degrees, giving it an unobstructed view of not only the front but the sides as well. There is a color sensor in the bottom of the robot allowing it to detect edges and avoid driving off elevated surfaces. Steering is on the back axle similar to most forklifts. The robot also has two spring-loaded payloads on top for some extra fun. I never got around to implicating my LIDAR navigation program.
