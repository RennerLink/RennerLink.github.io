Was built only using parts from the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Kit (Set 51515). An ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from a slider on the neck of the guitar. A color sensor detects when you wave anything in front of the guitar. Unfortunately, I never got to play it because I ended up parting it out before I could write the programming.
