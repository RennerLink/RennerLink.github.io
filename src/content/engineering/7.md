The rear axle has a hanging form of suspension using a rubber band. The front steering is similar to a tricycle. Compared to other remote-controlled vehicles I've made, it is moderately fast. The LEGO Powered Up battery pack uses 6 AA batteries that severely weigh it down. To combat this, I used two L motors to drive the rear axle.
