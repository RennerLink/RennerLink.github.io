I started the Universal Lego sorter project to create a machine capable of sorting any LEGO part. A challenge was to do it all only using official LEGO parts and products. I completed the mechanical system that separates a pile of assorted parts into a steady queue of one part at a time, as seen in the images below. I ended the project once I got to the computer intelligence part of the project where a camera would recognize the part and tell a distribution robot where to put it.
