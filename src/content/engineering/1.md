Over 3ft tall when extended. This robotic arm stands on four wheels to allow for an extra axis of motion. The main challenge for this build was having structural stability while keeping the frame relatively thin and compact. All major joints are locked in place using worm gears but can rotate when a connected knob turns. It was a non-robotic prototype. I learned techniques for locking joints and the importance of weight distribution for balance.
