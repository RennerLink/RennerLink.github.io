This chassis can drift on ice thanks to its high speed, torque, and lightweight design. The battery pack is above the slim frame for extra ground clearance. I was experimenting with compact steering racks, and it was a snow day so I decided to add a frame and back axle. Using the LEGO Powered Up electronics system, its controlled using a smartphone through Bluetooth.
